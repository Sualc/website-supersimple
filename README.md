Try to test a web page, learn some about.

Tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QU3kLFPdg

But seems I made something wrong.
After "Setings" "Page" "none to main change" "save" 
The message "Your site is ready to be published at https:// etc dont come.

~30' later refresh and again refresh.
Nothing hapens.

Then I added this readme.md file and now seems to work. GREAT !!!

Then was a time to rename youtube.html to index.html.
All working fine at the moment.
